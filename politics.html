                    <p> Althogh the Korean war ended in 1953, Norht and South Korean have <br>
                        never actually got to anything, until a few days ago. <br>
                        The president of South Korea Yoo Suk-yeol and the supreme governor <br>
                        Kim Jong-un had a talk and are trying to get to an agreement. <br>
                        This is the first talk attempt since more than 50 years. Could this <br>
                        be the end finally of the tention between the two sides of Korea?
