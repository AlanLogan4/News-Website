            <p>The Company RLP has created a device that will allow people to "live" their movies.The device would work like a vr dvd player but it would only work with special movies. <br>
                These movies have a special software which makes it like a videogame. The person would be playing like the main character and the movie would be changing depending on the person choice. <br>
                All this is posible because of an AI that creates scenarios that best suits the choice of the person. The person would become the main character of the story but if the character gets injure of dies <br>
                 nothing happens to the "player".
