            <img class="height-pictures" src="images/entretainmentPicture1.jpg" alt="picture of a girl with a vr set, a sword, and a shield fighting">
            <p>The Company RLP has created a device that will allow people to "live" their movies. <br>
                The device would work like a vr dvd player but it would only work with special movies. <br>
                These movies have a special software which makes it like a videogame. <br>
                The person would be playing like the main character and the movie would be changing <br>
                depending on the person choice. All this is posible because of an AI that creates scenarios that <br>
                best suits the choice of the person. The person would become the main character of the story <br>
                 but if the character gets injure of dies nothing happens to the "player".
